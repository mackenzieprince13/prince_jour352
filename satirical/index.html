    <br>
    <p>Just in, The University of Maryland is cutting seven athletic programs, confusing the nation.</p>
    <p>In a shocking move, the University of Maryland will not have a football program, a men’s basketball program, a women’s basketball program, a field hockey program, a men’s lacrosse program, a women’s lacrosse program or a golf program.</p>
    <p>Instead, the university will be prioritizing its investment into micromobility. After years of complaining by students, due to rules and regulations around the ownership of micromobility vehicles.</p>
    <p>“We want to be known for our advancement and progress. Collegiate sports have been around since the mid-19th century, that is part of the past. We want to innovate, and that means scooters. Scooters are the future of our university culture and competition," University of Maryland Athletic Director Jim Smith said.</p>
    <p>With major sports programs cut, the BIG Ten is now kicking the Terrapins out of the conference. The media rights agreement with the conference’s media rights partners is also severed. One would think that the University would suffer tremendous losses of revenue and have to have massive lay-offs. But, according to University of Maryland President Dr. Daryll Pines, that is not the case.</p>
    <p>“Not going to lie, we’re projecting over $20 billion dollars in revenue with the new focus on scooters. Honestly, I think we’re cooking right now. This is a great move, haters can shut up. Scooters and other electric mobility vehicles are going to be a trillion dollar business. I am currently buying stock into VeoRide right now. I actually put my life savings on it,” Pines said.</p>
    <p>Life-savings withstanding, The University of Maryland Office of Budget and Finance has backed up the statement provided by Pines. The University is expecting tremendous growth with just the focus on scooters.</p>

    <p>However, the big question is, what happens to the staff and players in the cut athletic programs? Due to the great reporting from Team Broccoli, that vital question can be answered. Everyone will be gone, and is fired, all players' scholarships are rescinded. The University of Maryland is not welcoming them anymore.</p>
    <p>“I’m not even mad. When I started playing football at Maryland, only one thought consumed my mind; how do I get around traffic and construction? One day at practice it came to me, scooters. So I signed a NIL deal with VeoRides, promocode Malik Washington to get 20% off on VeoRides, best decision of my life. Screw Maryland Football,” Maryland Football starting Quarterback Malik Washington said.</p>
    <p>>Not everyone is happy with the situation though. Long-time and beloved mascot, Testudo, will be let go alongside all the staff members and players. For the first time in history the mascot sat down for an interview. Our investigative team was able to figure out why Testudo is upset, and who is replacing the Terrapin.</p>
    <p>“This is such F—----  bulls—-. I hope Jim Smith and Daryll Pines get fired into the sun, they are replacing me? They are replacing the greatest mascot in all of sports? I am the reason why people come to this university, and they are replacing me with Astro The Scooter? That’s not even a mascot, what the hell is going on!” Testudo said.</p>
    <p>Testudo further commented that she is now homeless living on route one behind the McDonalds.</p>
    <p>In major decisions like this, students are often thought of in the background and don’t have much of a voice. That continued to happen, as the University of Maryland SGA forgot that they were able to meet with the school’s president and athletic director to talk about the issue.</p>
    <p>Shockingly though, the general student body was overwhelmingly supportive to cut the sports programs in favor of getting free scooters, micromobility courses, and scooter competitions.</p>

    <p>“Now I don’t have to walk anywhere anymore, this is the best day of my life. I can even scooter around my apartment. Also, who ever had fun watching Maryland Football? I think we’re all way better off without them,” 10th year University of Maryland Senior James Consoli said.</p>
    <p>There will be no more walking paths, they are now relabeled scooter paths. The University will be hiring traffic cops for each of it’s scooter paths.</p>
    <p>“Scooter nation, let's ride,” Smith said.</p>
